As a result, distortions in the information and decisions geopardize the company. Higher the hierarchical pyramid, greater the risk of distortions.</p></div><div class="flex-even markdown-inner"><h2 id=to-what-to-change>To what to change?</h2><p>Every 30 years, since the invention of Henry Ford&rsquo;s <strong>factory process</strong> one century ago in 1920, there have been major transformations in process management.</p><p>William Deming in the 50&rsquo;s started a revolution in Asian countries with the <strong>Statistical Process Control</strong>, followed by <strong>Just inTime</strong> introduced by Toyota, and <strong>Total Productive Maintenance</strong> created by Seiichi Nakajima.</p><p><img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86032/79045707-d1266080-7be2-11ea-9679-7613181368a3.png alt="50 2 1 TPM 2 ref small"></p><p>In the 80&rsquo;s, Eli Goldratt, author of the literary success &ldquo;The Goal&rdquo;, brought Westerners back to the top with the widely used <strong>Theory of Constraints</strong>.</p><p>These initiatives had so far brought together valuable allies. Incorporating concepts originated from <strong>SPC</strong>, <strong>JIT</strong>, <strong>TPM</strong>, and <strong>TOC</strong> leads to one of the most powerful combinations of decision support tools ever assembled in history.</p></div><div class="flex-even markdown-inner"><h2 id=how-to-change>How to change?</h2><p>To tackle current problems head-on, it is necessary to avoid wasting energy by managing conflicts between competing departments, companies, countries, continents, and so on.

Showing why they are the main link of the production line, the consumers release the vital energy that generates the product demand. Cycling at a speed determined by the process constraint, products and money start to spin in opposite directions, resulting in the Gain that powers bAmpli, the Business Amplifier.</blockquote><div class="book-columns flex flex-wrap"><div class="flex-even markdown-inner"><p><img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86032/79046804-5dd41d00-7be9-11ea-9239-780095caaffb.png alt="Y3 1 Cyclo bw"></p><p>The operation of the Process does not have a one-time and done behavior. The processing repeats endlessly for each product! Assets are always entered, processed for some time and follow to the next step, simultaneously, like a n-stroke engine.</p><p>At the top, Earth&rsquo;s first arrow to “Sn” indicates the money from the consumer market that pays for Product Sales (PS). This money is used to pay the Raw Materials (RM) used in the process steps. The remaining balance is the Gain (G) which contributes to the net profit of the company.</p><p>On the other hand, the outer arrows leaving Earth to &ldquo;S1&rdquo; represent the assets that traverse the path in the opposite direction. Raw materials are purchased from the market, enter into the Process, and become products that the company intends to sell.</p></div><div class="flex-even markdown-inner"><p><img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86032/79046226-0aac9b00-7be6-11ea-9664-d33b7c5b99cd.png alt="Y3 3 bampli Lucro bw"></p><p>The Plan consists of managing Cyclos feeding the company with their respective Gains. The &ldquo;+&rdquo; symbol at the top represents the investor. In addition to the plan, the system also captures the naked Reality. The function of the Administration is to confront Plan & Reality, promoting the actions of managers and investors to fix any differences. Operating Expense should be fed into to cover Labor and Overhead expenses.</p><p>Administration has &ldquo;+&rdquo; and &ldquo;-&rdquo; entries, where respectively Plan & Reality come in. Cyclo is what is expected to happen, or the positive input. If there is a disparity, an action must be taken. For example, when the Gain is negative, it is necessary to inject Investment, in order to keep Cyclo spinning. This maybe not expected but it happens!</p></div></div><blockquote class="book-hint info"><strong>Ampli Business Circuits allow the development of unlimited Cyclo and bAmpli topologies.
